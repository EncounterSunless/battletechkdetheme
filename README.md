# battletechkdetheme
Looking to change desktop environment to be a BattleTech theme style environment for KDE desktops

Will be adding a bash script that will allow for your kde desktop to be updated with desktop images, settings and styles to be as close to a Batteltech theme as possible. What I would like for this to be is a start for mutiple desktop themes to be contributes and made for different users. This will be a short term project to focus on creating and uploading simple bash script to set themes essentially quickly and easily.
